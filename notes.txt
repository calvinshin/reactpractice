App is an application that gathers data from components and creates and application
App is then exported and is used in the index to be rendered.
App has to be capitalized.

Index is what is actually rendered; putting app as a separate file hides and only displays the return values of the application in the index.
React is imported to use JSX

%PUBLIC_URL%

ReactDOM.render also renders data from the app.js into the index; what is returned is what is displayed there.
